# TIC TAC TOE

## Introduction

This game was fun to build, it was first project where i took a bit different approach, i was introduced to module pattern and factory functions and it was expected of me to not have any global variables. 

I made my own svg - the board with tree branches and instead of always doing the X's and O's as a standard approach i used owls.

I made the game responsive. 

I would definitely like to take this to the next step and implement AI and made 3 stages of difficulty.
